ljacklm: Linux (kernel 2.6) and Mac OS X high-level LabJack U12 library and C
examples
10/25/2013
support@labjack.com


This package contains the libljacklm high-level library for the U12 and examples
written in C.  The examples demonstrate libljacklm library usage.  The library
is a port of the ljackuw high-level Windows driver, and uses the Exodriver for
low-level USB communications.  The functions are documented in section 4 of the
U12 User's Guide and in the ljacklm.h header.

Refer to the INSTALL file for library requirements, build and installation
instructions.

Function execution times are comparable to one ones documented in section 4.x in
the U12 User's Guide.

Note to Mac OS X users:

The libusb_get_device_list libusb call tends to be slow, causing 900+ ms
overhead when a device needs to be found and opened over USB.  This overhead
will be seen in your program's first liblackue function call that communicates
with a U12.  Subsequent function calls to the U12 in the program  will be the
standard 20 ms execution time unless an error occurs.


Contents of this package:

The libljacklm directory contains the following:
   * The libljacklm library source and header files, ljacklm.c and
     ljacklm.h, and the Makefile for Linux and Mac OS X.

The examples directory contains the following:
   * This directory contains U12 code examples written in C.  The examples use 
     the ljacklm header file installed in the /usr/local/include directory and
     the ljacklm library installed in the /usr/local/lib directory.  The
     applications created from the code run in a terminal.  


The INSTALL file provides requirements and installation instructions for the
liblabjackusb library, along with instructions on building the examples.
